# Metrics Reference

How each metric is calculated, what it means, and how to act on it.

## Summary

Basic counts aggregated from the JSONL dataset.

| Metric | Calculation | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Total commits | Count of `commit` records | Excludes merge commit file diffs (merges counted but no file records) |
| Total devs | Count of unique author emails | Committer-only emails excluded (e.g. Co-Authored-By) |
| Total files | Count of unique `path_current` values | Files that were deleted still count if they appeared |
| Additions/Deletions | Sum from commit records | Recalculated when `--ignore` is used |
| Merge commits | Commits with >1 parent | Detected from `commit_parent` records |

## Contributors

Ranked by commit count, grouped by author email.

- Same person with different emails appears as separate entries unless `--mailmap` is used during extraction
- Additions/deletions are per-author totals across all their commits

## Hotspots

Files ranked by number of commits that touched them.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Commits | Number of commits that modified this file |
| Churn | additions + deletions across all commits |
| Devs | Unique author emails that modified this file |

**How to interpret**: High churn + few devs = knowledge silo. High churn + many devs = shared bottleneck, possible design issue.

## Directories

Same as hotspots but aggregated by directory path. Files in the repository root are grouped under `.`.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| File Touches | Sum of per-file commit counts. **A single commit touching N files in this directory contributes N to this number — this is NOT distinct commits.** |
| Churn | Sum of additions + deletions for all files |
| Files | Number of unique files in the directory |
| Devs | Unique authors who touched any file in the directory |
| Bus Factor | Minimum devs covering 80% of lines changed (see Bus Factor) |

**How to interpret**: Gives a module-level health view. Watch the `File Touches` name — it inflates relative to what people intuitively call "commits" when commits are large.

## Activity

Commits and line changes bucketed by time period.

- Granularity: `day`, `week`, `month` (default), `year`
- Additions and deletions are summed per period from commit records
- Periods with zero activity are omitted

**How to interpret**: Spikes may indicate releases or sprints. Sustained drops may signal attrition or project wind-down.

## Bus Factor

For each file/directory: the minimum number of developers whose contributions cover 80% of all lines changed.

**Calculation**:
1. For each file, collect all authors and their total lines changed (additions + deletions)
2. Sort authors by lines changed, descending
3. Sum from the top until cumulative sum reaches 80% of total
4. Count of authors needed = bus factor

**Bus factor 1** = one person owns 80%+ of the changes. If they leave, the knowledge is lost.

**How to interpret**: Files with bus factor 1 and high recent churn are the highest risk. Cross-reference with churn-risk.

> **Caveat — weighted by lines, not commits.** A dev with one big 10k-line commit outweighs 100 small commits. If familiarity matters more than volume to you, treat bus factor as an upper bound on knowledge loss risk, not a direct measurement.

## Coupling

File pairs that frequently change in the same commit.

**Calculation**:
1. For each commit with 2-N files (skipping single-file commits and commits with >50 files by default), generate all file pairs
2. Exclude pairs from **mechanical-refactor commits**: a commit touching ≥ `refactorMinFiles` (10) with mean per-file churn < `refactorMaxChurnPerFile` (5 lines) is treated as a global rename / format / lint fix, and its pairs are skipped. The files' individual change counts (`changes_A`, `changes_B`) still include these commits — only the pair accumulation is suppressed.
3. Count co-occurrences per pair
4. Coupling % = co-changes / min(changes_A, changes_B) × 100

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Co-changes | Number of commits where both files changed |
| Coupling % | How tightly linked — 100% means every time the less-active file changes, the other changes too |
| Changes A/B | Individual change counts for context |

**How to interpret**:
- Test + code at 90%+: healthy (tests co-evolve)
- Interface + implementation at 100%: expected
- Unrelated modules at 50%+: hidden dependency, refactoring opportunity

Based on Adam Tornhill's ["Your Code as a Crime Scene"](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/) methodology.

> **Caveat — co-change is not causation.** Two files changing in the same commit proves they were touched by the same unit of work, not that one depends on the other. The refactor filter catches the most blatant false positives (global renames, format passes) but not all — a genuinely large feature touching many related files can still leak pair counts. Treat high coupling % as a hypothesis worth investigating, not a proof of architectural dependency.
>
> **Caveat — the refactor filter uses mean churn.** A commit mixing many mechanical renames (low churn each) with a few substantive edits (high churn each) can have mean > 5 and escape the filter. Example: 12 renames of 1 line + 3 real edits of 100 lines → mean ≈ 21, filter does not fire, and the 12 rename-participating files generate ~66 spurious pairs. Per-file weighting would fix this but requires restructuring pair generation; it is an acknowledged limitation rather than a planned change.
>
> **Caveat — rename commits below `refactorMinFiles` leak.** A commit renaming 8 files (say, a small module rename) has zero churn per file but only 8 files, so the filter does not fire. Pairs are generated between old paths and then re-keyed onto the canonical (new) paths by the rename tracker. Each such pair has `CoChanges = 1`, so any sensible `--coupling-min-changes` threshold (≥ 2) filters them out of display. Readers inspecting raw data may still see the residual pairs.
>
> **Caveat — `--coupling-max-files` below the refactor threshold disables the filter.** The refactor filter only runs for commits with `≥ refactorMinFiles` (10) files, but the existing `--coupling-max-files` gate runs first. Setting `--coupling-max-files` below 10 discards those commits outright (no pairs at all), so the refactor filter becomes dead code. This is correct layering but worth knowing if you tune the flag aggressively.

## Churn Risk

Files ranked by recency-weighted churn, **classified into actionable labels** so the reader can judge whether the activity is a problem or just ongoing work.

### Ranking

Sort key: `recent_churn` descending (tiebreak: lower `bus_factor` first).

`recent_churn` uses exponential decay:
```
weight = e^(-λ × days_since_change)
recent_churn = Σ (additions + deletions) × weight
λ = ln(2) / half_life_days
```

Default half-life: 90 days (changes lose half their weight every 90 days).

### Classification labels

Ranking alone conflates "core being actively developed by one author" (expected)
with "legacy module everyone forgot" (urgent). The label separates them by
adding age and trend dimensions.

**Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins.** Conditions on later
rows implicitly assume the earlier rows didn't match.

| # | Label | Rule | Action |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | **cold** | `recent_churn ≤ 0.5 × median(recent_churn)` | Ignore. |
| 2 | **active** | `bus_factor ≥ 3` | Healthy, shared. |
| 3 | **active-core** | `bus_factor ≤ 2` and `age < 180 days` | New code, single author is expected. |
| 4 | **legacy-hotspot** | `bus_factor ≤ 2`, `age ≥ 180 days`, and `trend < 0.5` | **Urgent.** Old + concentrated + declining. |
| 5 | **silo** | default (everything the rules above didn't catch) | Knowledge bottleneck — plan transfer. |

Where:
- `age = days between firstChange and latest commit in dataset`
- `trend = churn_last_3_months / churn_earlier` (1 if neither side has signal; 2 if recent-only)

### Additional columns

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `risk_score` | `recent_churn / bus_factor` — legacy composite. Still consumed by `gitcortex ci --fail-on-churn-risk N`. Not used for ranking. May diverge from the label (a file can have low `risk_score` but be classified `legacy-hotspot`, and vice versa). |
| `first_change`, `last_change` | Bounds of the file's activity in the dataset (UTC) |
| `age_days` | `latest - first_change` in days |
| `trend` | Ratio described above |

### How to interpret

- **legacy-hotspot** is the alarm — investigate first.
- **silo** suggests pairing / documentation work, not panic.
- **active-core** is usually fine, but watch for `bus_factor=1` + growing.
- **active** with growing trend may indicate a healthy shared module or a collision of too many cooks.

## Working Patterns

Commit distribution by day of week and hour.

- Uses author date (not committer date)
- Hours are in the author's **local** timezone as recorded by git — this metric describes human work rhythm, not UTC instants
- Displayed as a 7×24 heatmap

**How to interpret**: Reveals team timezones, work-life patterns, and off-hours work. Consistent late-night commits may indicate overwork.

> The per-developer working grid in `profile` uses the same local-timezone semantics.

## Developer Network

Collaboration graph based on shared file ownership.

**Calculation**:
1. For each file, collect each author's line contribution
2. For each pair of authors who share files:
   - `shared_files` = count of files both touched (any amount)
   - `shared_lines` = `Σ min(lines_A, lines_B)` across shared files
   - `weight` = `shared_files / max(files_A, files_B) × 100` (legacy)

Sort is by `shared_lines` descending (tiebreak by `shared_files`).

**How to interpret**:
- `shared_lines` is the honest signal. Alice editing 1 line and Bob editing 200 on the same file share only 1 line of real collaboration — `shared_lines` reflects this, `shared_files` doesn't.
- Strong `shared_lines` = deep co-ownership. Low `shared_lines` with high `shared_files` = trivial touches (one-line fixes, format commits).
- Isolated nodes may signal silos.

## Profile

Per-developer report combining multiple metrics.

| Field | Calculation |
|-------|------------|
| Commits | Count of commits by this author |
| Lines changed | additions + deletions across all commits |
| Files touched | Unique files modified (from `contribFiles` accumulator) |
| Active days | Unique dates with at least one commit |
| Pace | commits / active_days (smooths bursts — a dev with 100 commits on 2 days and silence for 28 shows pace=50, which reads as a steady rate but isn't) |
| Weekend % | commits on Saturday+Sunday / total commits × 100 |
| Scope | Top 5 directories by unique file count, as % of total files touched |
| Contribution type | Based on del/add ratio: growth (<0.4), balanced (0.4-0.8), refactor (>0.8) |
| Collaborators | Top 5 devs sharing code with this dev. Ranked by `shared_lines` (Σ min(linesA, linesB) across shared files), tiebreak `shared_files`, then email. Same `shared_lines` semantics as the Developer Network metric — discounts trivial one-line touches so "collaborator" reflects real overlap. |

## Top Commits

Commits ranked by total lines changed (additions + deletions).

- Message is included if extracted with `--include-commit-messages`, truncated to 80 characters
- Useful for identifying large imports, generated code, or risky big-bang changes

## Pareto (Concentration)

How asymmetric is the work distribution.

**Calculation**: For each dimension, sort by the metric descending and count how many items are needed to reach 80% of the total.

| Dimension | Sort key | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Files | Churn (additions + deletions) | — |
| Devs (commits) | Commit count | Rewards frequent committers. Inflated by bots and squash-off workflows. |
| Devs (churn) | additions + deletions | Rewards volume of lines written/removed. Inflated by generated-file authors and verbose coders. |
| Directories | Churn (additions + deletions) | — |

Two dev lenses are surfaced because commit count alone is a flawed proxy for contribution: a squash-merge counts as one commit while a rebase-and-merge counts as many; bots routinely dominate commit leaderboards despite writing little code. Rather than replace one bias with another, gitcortex shows both and lets the divergence be the signal.

**Reading the divergence**:
- Aligned counts (e.g. 17 ≈ 17) → consistent contributor base; both lenses agree.
- Commits ≫ churn (e.g. 267 vs 132 on kubernetes) → bots or squash workflows inflate commit counts. The smaller list is closer to "who actually wrote code".
- Churn ≫ commits → single heavy-feature authors who commit rarely but write volumes.

**Judgment thresholds**:
- ≤10%: extremely concentrated (plus "key-person dependence" on the Devs-by-commits card)
- ≤25%: moderately concentrated
- \>25%: well distributed
- total == 0 (no commits, or no churn for the churn lens): no data (neutral marker)

**How to interpret**: "20 files concentrate 80% of all churn" describes where change lands — it can indicate a healthy core module under active development, or a bottleneck if combined with low bus factor. Cross-reference with the Churn Risk section before drawing conclusions.

## Data Flow

```
git log --raw --numstat    ─── stream ──→ JSONL ──→ streaming load ──→ Dataset ──→ stats
git cat-file --batch-check ─── sizes  ─↗
```

- Extraction reads git metadata only (never source code)
- Commit messages excluded by default
- Stats computed from pre-aggregated maps (not raw records)
- All processing is 100% local

## Behavior and caveats

### Thresholds

Every classification boundary is a named constant in `internal/stats/stats.go`. Values below are the defaults; there is no runtime flag to override them yet — changing a threshold requires editing the source and rebuilding.

| Constant | Default | Controls |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `classifyColdChurnRatio` | `0.5` | A file is `cold` when `recent_churn ≤ ratio × median(recent_churn)`. |
| `classifyActiveBusFactor` | `3` | A file is `active` (shared, healthy) when `bus_factor ≥ this`. |
| `classifyOldAgeDays` | `180` | Age cutoff for `active-core` vs `silo`/`legacy-hotspot`. |
| `classifyDecliningTrend` | `0.5` | Trend ratio below this marks `legacy-hotspot` (old + declining). |
| `classifyTrendWindowMonths` | `3` | Window (months, relative to latest commit) for the recent vs earlier split in `trend`. |
| `contribRefactorRatio` | `0.8` | `del/add ≥ this` → dev profile `contribType = refactor`. |
| `contribBalancedRatio` | `0.4` | `0.4 ≤ del/add < 0.8` → `balanced`; below 0.4 → `growth`. |
| `refactorMinFiles` | `10` | Minimum files for a commit to be a mechanical-refactor candidate (coupling filter). |
| `refactorMaxChurnPerFile` | `5.0` | Mean churn per file below this in a candidate commit → treated as refactor; its pairs are excluded from coupling. |

### Reproducibility

Every ranking function has an explicit tiebreaker so the same input produces the same output across runs and between the CLI (`stats --format json`) and the HTML report. Without this, ties on integer keys (ubiquitous — e.g. many files with `bus_factor = 1`) would let Go's randomized map iteration produce a different top-N each time.

| Stat | Primary key (desc unless noted) | Tiebreaker |
|------|---------------------------------|------------|
| `summary` | — | N/A (scalar) |
| `contributors` | commits | email asc |
| `hotspots` | commits | path asc |
| `directories` | file_touches | dir asc |
| `busfactor` | bus_factor (asc) | path asc |
| `coupling` | co_changes | coupling_pct |
| `churn-risk` | recent_churn | bus_factor asc |
| `top-commits` | lines_changed | sha asc |
| `dev-network` | shared_lines | shared_files |
| `profile` | commits | email asc |

A third-level tiebreaker on path/sha/email asc is applied where primary and secondary can both tie (`churn-risk`, `coupling`, `dev-network`) so ordering is stable even with exact equality on the first two keys. Inside each profile, the `TopFiles`, `Scope`, and `Collaborators` sub-lists are also sorted with explicit tiebreakers (path / dir / email asc) so their internal ordering is deterministic too.

### `--mailmap` off by default

`extract` does not apply `.mailmap` unless you pass `--mailmap`. Without it, the same person with two emails (e.g. `alice@work.com` and `alice@personal.com`) splits into two contributors. Affected metrics: `contributors`, `bus factor`, `dev network`, `profiles`, churn-risk label (via bus factor).

Extract emits a warning when the repo has a `.mailmap` file but the flag was omitted. Enable it for any repo where identity matters:
```bash
gitcortex extract --repo . --mailmap
```

### `--ignore` can desynchronize commit-level and file-level totals

Commit-level fields (`Summary.TotalAdditions/Deletions`) are computed from the `commit` records in JSONL. File-level aggregations (`Hotspots.Churn`, `DirectoryStats.Churn`) come from the `commit_file` records. When `--ignore` filters files during extraction, the commit totals are not re-computed — so `Σ hotspot.churn ≠ TotalAdditions + TotalDeletions`. This is not a bug, but the difference is not surfaced anywhere.

### Timezone handling

Two classes of metrics, different rules:

- **Cross-commit aggregation** (monthly/weekly/yearly buckets, active-day counts, trend calculation, display dates) uses **UTC**. Two commits at the same UTC instant land in the same bucket regardless of each author's local offset.
- **Human-rhythm metrics** (working patterns heatmap, per-dev work grid) use the **author's local timezone** as recorded by git. These describe *when the person was typing*, not instant-of-time.

Side effects worth knowing:
- A commit at `2024-03-31T23:00-05:00` (local) equals `2024-04-01T04:00Z` (UTC). It belongs to **April** in monthly activity but to **March 31** in the author's working grid.
- `active_days` is counted by UTC date. A developer who always commits near midnight local time may show slightly different day counts than a pure local-TZ count.
- `first_commit_date` / `last_commit_date` in the summary are UTC.
- **Working patterns trust the author's committed timezone.** If a dev has their laptop clock set wrong or a CI agent impersonates the author in UTC, the heatmap silently reflects that. There is no sanity check.

### Rename tracking

gitcortex uses `git log -M` so renames and moves (including cross-directory moves) are detected by git's similarity matcher. When a rename is detected, the historical entries for the old and new paths are **merged into a single canonical entry** (the newest path in the chain) during finalization.

Effects:
- `Total files touched` reflects canonical files, not distinct paths seen in history.
- `firstChange`, `monthChurn`, and `devLines` on the canonical entry span the **full history** including pre-rename commits.
- Rename chains (`A → B → C`) collapse to `C`.
- Files renamed to each other and later co-changing don't produce self-pairs in coupling.
- `FilesTouched` in developer profiles counts canonical paths, so one dev editing a file before and after a rename counts as **one** file.

Limits:
- Git's rename detection defaults to ~50% similarity. A rename with heavy edits may not be detected, resulting in separate delete + add entries.
- Copies (`C*` status) are **not** merged — copied files legitimately live as two entries.
- If the rename commit falls outside a `--since` filter, the edge isn't captured and the old/new paths stay separate within the filtered window.
- **Path reuse:** when the same path appears as the source of **multiple** rename events (e.g. `A` renamed to `B` in old history, then the name `A` was reused for an unrelated file that was later renamed to `D`), the two lineages are already conflated in `ds.files["A"]` at ingest time, and we cannot disambiguate them without per-commit temporal tracking. Rather than misattributing one lineage to the other target, gitcortex **refuses to migrate** any edge whose oldPath appears more than once. Concretely: `ds.files["A"]` stays put (with both lineages merged, same as without the rename tracker), `B` keeps only its post-rename history, and `D` keeps only its post-rename history. This is underattribution, not misattribution — neither target receives data that belongs to the other lineage.

### `--since` filter + ChurnRisk age

`firstChange` is the first time a file appears **in the filtered dataset**, not in repo history. When you run `--since=30d`, a file created 4 years ago but touched yesterday gets `age_days ≈ 0` and classifies as `active-core` — even though it's genuinely legacy.

If you need the label to reflect true age, either extract without `--since` (then filter queries in post), or treat label output under a `--since` run as "what's happening in this window" rather than "what kind of file is this".

### Classification degenerate edge cases

- **Renames reverted (cycle A→B→A).** The resolver bails out of the cycle with the current path; it doesn't crash but the "canonical" is implementation-defined for cyclic inputs.
- **Repo with single file.** The median-based `cold` threshold degenerates (median is that file's churn); the single file is never classified `cold`.
- **All files with identical churn.** Median equals every value, `lowChurn = median × 0.5`, so nothing is `cold`. Everything falls into the bf/age/trend tree.
